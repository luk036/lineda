two stage op amp example

To change a process library, modify the .lib line in opamp.sp

There are totally three sizing emphasis, either on bandwidth,
phase margin, or open loop gain. But all begin with the starting

i.e., Id = (1/2)u*Cox(W/L)(Vgs-Vth)^2.

Need to addpath ggplab.

The main file is opamp.m -->
