0.35um CMOS Inverter
Wn and Wp are input variables
Falltime and Risetime are measured
Area is of concern
****************************
convex B-spline and posynomial model are fitted
optimization is applied to minimize area, subject to
transition time constraints and matching constraints,
i.e.,

min   AREA
s.t.  T_rise < xx
      T_rise == T_fall
